Intuition:-

The goal of the function getCount is to count the number of vowels (specifically 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u') in a given string str.

Approach:-

Initialization:
Initialize a variable count to keep track of the number of vowels found in the string. Set it initially to 0.
Iterate Through String:
Loop through each character of the input string str.
Check for Vowels:
For each character in the string, check if it is one of the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
If the character is a vowel, increment the count variable.
Return Count:
After iterating through the entire string, return the final value of count, which represents the total number of vowels found in the string.
This approach efficiently counts the occurrences of vowels in the string by iterating through each character and checking if it matches any of the vowels, incrementing the count accordingly.
