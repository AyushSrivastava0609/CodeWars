Intuition:-

The areYouPlayingBanjo function aims to determine whether a person's name indicates that they play the banjo. 
If the name starts with the letter "R" (uppercase or lowercase), it suggests that the person plays the banjo.

Approach:-

Check First Letter:
Retrieve the first letter of the given name.

Check if the First Letter Indicates Banjo Playing:
Use the includes() method to check if the first letter is "R" (uppercase) or "r" (lowercase), indicating banjo playing.
Store the result in variables res and res1 respectively.

Return Result:
If either res or res1 is true, it means that the name suggests banjo playing.
Return a string indicating whether the person plays banjo or not based on the result.

Note: The function checks only the first letter of the name to determine banjo playing, ignoring the rest of the name. 
This approach assumes that the convention for indicating banjo playing is consistent across names.
