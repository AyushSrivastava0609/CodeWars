Intuition:-

The fibonacci function aims to generate the first n Fibonacci numbers and return them as an array.

Approach:-

Initialization:
Initialize variables first and second to represent the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1 respectively). Also, initialize an empty array result to store the Fibonacci numbers.

Generate Fibonacci Numbers:
Utilize a for loop to iterate n times, generating the Fibonacci numbers.

Handling Base Cases:
Within the loop, for the first two iterations (i=0 and i=1), directly add the values 0 and 1 to the result array respectively.

Calculate Fibonacci Numbers:
For subsequent iterations (i>1), calculate the next Fibonacci number by adding first and second, and store the result in the sum variable.
Add the sum to the result array.

Update Variables:
Update first to hold the value of second.
Update second to hold the value of sum.

Return Result:
Once the loop completes, return the result array containing the generated Fibonacci numbers.

Note: This approach efficiently generates Fibonacci numbers by iteratively adding the previous two numbers.
It ensures that each Fibonacci number is computed based on the values of the preceding two numbers.
