Intuition:-

The smash method concatenates an array of strings into a single string with each word separated by a space.

Approach:-

Check if the input array words is null or empty.
If the array is null or empty, return an empty string.
Otherwise, use the String.join method to concatenate all the words with a space separator.
Return the resulting concatenated string.
