Intuition:
The function getMiddle aims to find the middle character(s) of a given string s. If the length of the string is odd, it returns the middle character. If the length is even, it returns the two middle characters.

Approach:

Calculating the Middle Index:

We calculate the middle index of the string by dividing the length of the string by 2. Since array indices start from 0, we round up the result using Math.ceil to ensure we get the correct index for odd-length strings.
Handling Even-Length Strings:

If the length of the string is even (determined by checking if the remainder of the length divided by 2 is 0), we return the concatenation of the characters at the middle index and the next index. This gives us the two middle characters of the string.
Handling Odd-Length Strings:

If the length of the string is odd, we directly return the character at the middle index.
Returning the Result:

We return the middle character(s) based on the length of the string.
Example:
Let's say we have the string "abcdef":

Length of the string: 6
Middle index: 6 / 2 = 3
Since the length is even, we return the concatenation of characters at index 2 and 3: "cd"
If we have the string "abcde":

Length of the string: 5
Middle index: 5 / 2 = 2.5 (rounded up to 3)
Since the length is odd, we directly return the character at index 2: "c"
This approach efficiently finds the middle character(s) of the string based on its length. It has a time complexity of O(1), as it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the length of the input string.
