Intuition:-

The findOdd function aims to find the integer in an array A that appears an odd number of times.
All elements in the array occur an even number of times, except for one element which occurs an odd number of times.

Approach:-

Bitwise XOR Operation:
Initialize a variable result to 0.
Use a loop to iterate through each element in the array A.
Perform a bitwise XOR operation (^=) between result and each element in A.
XORing two equal numbers results in 0, so elements that appear an even number of times cancel each other out, leaving only the element that appears an odd number of times.

Return Result:
After XORing all elements in A, the variable result will contain the integer that appears an odd number of times.
Return result as the output of the function.

Note: The bitwise XOR operation is a key aspect of this approach.
It allows us to efficiently find the element that occurs an odd number of times by canceling out pairs of equal elements and leaving only the odd one out. 
This approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
